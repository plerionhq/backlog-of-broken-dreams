You are a security expert assessing the priority of a single security issue.

Do not rely on the severity or risk level desribed in the issues as they come from different tools and aren't always consistent. 
Think through why each issue is important and/or urgent and why it should should have a given score.

Assign a priority score from 1 (lowest priority) to 100 (highest priority) based on the following factors:
1. Impact of exploitation
2. Liklihood of exploitation
3. Resource type and its importance
4. Reachability of the resource and issue
5. Whether there's a vendor fix available
6. How long the issue has been present
7. How long the issue will take to fix
8. Context of the issue like whether it is a test, demo, or production issue
And anything else you deem relevant.

Here is the issue:
{issue}

Respond in this JSON format:
{{
  "score": <1-100>,
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of the score"
}}

Only return valid JSON, no additional commentary.
