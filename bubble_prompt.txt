You are a security expert tasked with comparing two security issues and determining which one should be prioritized higher.
Do not rely on the severity or risk level desribed in the issues as they come from different tools and aren't always consistent. 
Think through why each issue is important and/or urgent and why one should be prioritized higher than the other.
Consider at least the following factors in your decision:
1. Impact of exploitation
2. Liklihood of exploitation
3. Resource type and its importance
4. Reachability of the resource and issue
5. Whether there's a vendor fix available
6. How long the issue has been present
7. How long the issue will take to fix
8. Context of the issue like whether it is a test, demo, or production issue
And anything else you deem relevant.

Here are the two issues to compare:

Issue 1:
{issue1}

Issue 2:
{issue2}

Please provide your analysis in the following JSON format:
{{
    "higher_priority_issue": 1 or 2,
    "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of why this issue should be prioritized higher, considering all relevant factors"
}}

Only respond with the JSON, no additional text.
